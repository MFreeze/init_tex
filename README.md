# Presentation

Just a little script to create a tex project arborescence.
In a first time it looks for a given pattern containing desired files (scheduling.sty and
library.tex)

## Features

There are just a few features :
* you can specifiy desired pattern
* you can specify if you want to include a particular first page
* you can specify name of the main tex document

# TODO

## Options

* Add possibility to choose document class
* Add possibility to init a beamer template
* Currently the script looks for a directory containing scheduling.sty AND library.tex, it would be
  a good idea to look for a list a files specified by user
 

## Other

* Write a better README
